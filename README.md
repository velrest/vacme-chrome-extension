# Vacme Chrome extension

**This only works in Chrome as it is a Chrome extension!**

This extension is a result out of my frustration with the registration process
for a vaccination slot in Switzerland's vacme tool.

It is neither nice  nor very bullet proof code. It just works good enough for me to
be usable.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo into your desired directory
1. Type chrome://extensions into your URL bar
1. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
1. Press the "Load unpacked" button in the top left
1. Select the directory
1. Load the vacme site
1. And your done!

## Usage
You only receive a notification if there are available slots.
You can pause / resume the refresh and notification loop with
the link just above the drop-down.
